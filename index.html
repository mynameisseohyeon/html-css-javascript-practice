                I threw a wish in the well<br>
                Don't ask me, I'll never tell<br>
                I looked to you as it fell<br>
                And now you're in my way<br>
                I trade my soul for a wish<br>
                Pennies and dimes for a kiss<br>
                I wasn't looking for this<br>
                But now you're in my way
                </p>

                <p>
                Your stare was holdin'<br>
                Ripped jeans, skin was showin'<br>
                Hot night, wind was blowin'<br>
                Where you think you're going, baby?
                </p>

                <p>
                Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy<br>
                But here's my number, so call me, maybe<br>
                It's hard to look right at you, baby<br>
                But here's my number, so call me, maybe<br>
                Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy<br>
                But here's my number, so call me, maybe<br>
                And all the other boys try to chase me<br>
                But here's my number, so call me, maybe
                </p>

                <p>
                You took your time with the call<br>
                I took no time with the fall<br>
                You gave me nothing at all<br>
                But still, you're in my way<br>
                I beg and borrow and steal<br>
                At first sight, and it's real<br>
                I didn't know I would feel it<br>
                But it's in my way
                </p>
