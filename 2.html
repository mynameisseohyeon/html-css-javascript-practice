                Carly Rae Jepsen (born November 21, 1985) is a Canadian singer and songwriter.<br>
                Born and raised in Mission, British Columbia,<br>
                Jepsen pursued a musical theatre program at the Canadian College of Performing Arts in Victoria,<br>
                British Columbia. After completing her studies,<br>
                she relocated to Vancouver and competed on the fifth season of Canadian Idol in 2007,<br>
                placing third. In 2008, Jepsen released her folk-influenced debut studio album, Tug of War, in Canada.

                Jepsen's breakthrough came in 2012, when her single "Call Me Maybe"<br>
                achieved significant mainstream popularity; the song was the best-selling single of that year,<br>
                reaching number one in 18 countries.<br>
                As a result, she was signed to a joint worldwide record deal with School Boy Records and Interscope Records.<br>
                Jepsen's second studio album, Kiss, was released later that year.<br>
                It marked a greater shift into mainstream pop music and saw fair commercial success,<br>
                reaching the top ten in Canada and the United States.<br>
                In 2014, Jepsen made her Broadway stage debut as the titular character in Cinderella.<br>
                The following year, she released her third studio album, Emotion.<br>
                It is noted for its influence from 1980s music as well as blending dance-pop and synth-pop with indie sensibilities.<br>
                While less commercially successful than Kiss, it saw the success of its lead single,<br>
                "I Really Like You", and received wide critical acclaim.<br>
                In 2016 Jepsen performed in the television special Grease: Live and lent her voice to the animated film Ballerina.<br>
                Her fourth studio album, Dedicated, was released on May 17, 2019 and was similarly well-received by fans and critics.<br>
                Jepsen released a follow-up album titled Dedicated Side B one year later.
